  title: OSCAL REST
  description: |
    A draft proposal from [Easy Dynamics](https://www.easydynamics.com) of a REST API specification for interacting
      with [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) models.

    Standardized data models like OSCAL lay the groundwork for interoperability of systems, and an ecosystem of
    meaningful integrations can be brought to life through a standardized REST API. That interface needs to define
    simple CRUD operations, but should also describe how to manipulate relationships and make partial changes.

    Such an API will likely see the most success across various vendors and projects when maintained by a
    standards body or community, and we're looking to get that conversation started with this effort.

    ## Identifier Scope
    Note that all object identifiers are **scoped to the system** implementing the REST API
      and are expected to be unique.

    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      To associate a Party with a known Component Definition with a UUID you might:
      1. Search for the Party:
          ```
          GET /parties/search?query=bob
          ```
          ```
          [
            {
              "uuid": "d834ed5e-9652-4b78-87e7-a9f8686f4e60",
              "type": "person",
              "name": "Bob Johnson"
            }
          ]
          ```
      2. Use the found Party's ID to associate with the component definition:
          ```
          PUT /component-definitions/599b6fa5-3e18-4580-bd8f-8a181776c6e8/parties/d834ed5e-9652-4b78-87e7-a9f8686f4e60
          ```
    </details>

    ## Partial Payloads in PATCH Requests

    A `PATCH` should be used when an existing object needs a partial modification. It accepts a partial
    payload with the updated fields and corresponding field names, then modifies the specified
    fields accordingly. Additionally, it is solely additive when updating lists and will not replace
    existing list items. In most cases, a `PATCH` is more convenient than a `PUT`, which only accepts
    a full payload to completely replace the existing object with new updates.

    All updates to 'root' OSCAL objects via `PATCH` requests should accept a partial payload containing
    only the changed data and the entire updated object should be returned.

    The UUID of the root object must not change in the payload and implementations should throw an error
    if such a request is made.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Example request:
      ```
      PATCH /system-security-plans/cff8385f-108e-40a5-8f7a-82f3dc0eaba8
      {
        "system-security-plan": {
          "uuid": "cff8385f-108e-40a5-8f7a-82f3dc0eaba8",
          "metadata": {
            "title": "Some New Title"
            "revisions": [
              { "version": "220220517" }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the title is being updated and the version is being added to the list of
      revisions. No other changes are being made to the original metadata object, so the rest of its
      fields will remain the same. The list of revisions will still contain its previous items,
      along with the new version item.
    </details>
